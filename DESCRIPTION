Description: Doubly ranked tests are nonparametric tests for grouped functional and multivariate data.
    The testing procedure first ranks a matrix (or three dimensional array) of data by column (if a matrix) or by cell (across the third dimension if an array).
    It then calculates a sufficient statistic for the order in the sample using the observed ranks, taken over the columns or cells.
    Depending on the number of groups, G, the summarized ranks are then analyzed using either a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (G = 2) or a Kruskal-Wallis (G greater than 2).
